IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING A HEALTHY WEIGHT

Optimizing the immune system
Increases the energy levels
Improves mental health
Decreases the risk of Diabetes
Prevents Cancer
Efficient blood circulation
 
To make it easy for an individual to find out whether their weight lies in the healthy spectrum, tools like Body Mass Index is extremely helpful. 


WHAT IS BMI?

BMI (Body Mass Index) is a numerical value calculated using a person's weight and height. It is a simple and commonly used method to assess whether an individual has a healthy weight in relation to their height. BMI is calculated using the following formula:
       BMI = weight (in kilograms) / (height (in meters))^2
The resulting BMI value is then classified into different categories to determine weight status:
Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
Obesity (Class I): BMI between 30 and 34.9
Obesity (Class II): BMI between 35 and 39.9
Severe obesity (Class III): BMI 40 or higher

FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

Consideration of Body Composition: To overcome the limitation of BMI not distinguishing between fat and muscle mass, future enhancements could incorporate additional measurements or assessments of body composition. 
Incorporating Waist Circumference: Waist circumference is a significant indicator of abdominal obesity and is associated with increased health risks. Future BMI enhancements could consider incorporating waist circumference measurements in conjunction with BMI to better assess central obesity and associated health risks.
Personalized and Ethnic-specific Thresholds: Research has shown that BMI thresholds may need to be adjusted for different ethnic groups to account for variations in body composition and body fat distribution.
Contextual Factors: Future BMI enhancements could include the consideration of contextual factors such as age, gender, lifestyle, and physical activity levels.
